# Build a small app blog using Nest.js, React , MongoDB, and Ant-design 

## Getting Started
This prototype is divided into two separate sections. Namely the Backend ( Built with Nest.js) and the frontend ( Built with React ).

### Clone the repository
To easily set up the application, clone this repository which contains directory for both sections of the project ( i.e `be` and `fe`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmuz187/GC_06.03.2024_nestjs_reactjs_antd.git
```

## Change directory into the newly cloned project
```bash
cd nest-react-project
```

## Backend
### Change directory into the backend
```bash
cd be
```

### Install backend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Create .env file
Once the installation process is complete, create a `.env` file:


### Run the backend app

```bash
nest start
```


### MongoDB
Ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your machine before running the application. I have this fully setup on my mac already.

## Frontend
Open another terminal from the `nest-react-project` and navigate to the `blog-frontend` folder to setup the frontend

### Frontend dependencies
```bash
cd fe
npm install
```

### Create .env file in frontend

### Run the frontend app

```bash
npm start
```


### Test the application
Finally open your browser and view the application on http://localhost:3000
